Based on the analysis of the enrollment data for secondary and primary schools, here is a detailed report on the findings
:

### Regression Analysis for Secondary Schools:

1. **R-squared and Adjusted R-squared:**
   - The R-squared value of 0.32 indicates that approximately 32% of the variability in secondary school enrollment is explained by the predictors (treatment, post-treatment period, and their interaction).
   - However, the adjusted R-squared value of -0.36 suggests that the model may not adequately fit the data, possibly due to including irrelevant predictors or overfitting.

2. **Multiple R:**
   - The multiple R, representing the correlation between the predicted and actual enrollment values for secondary schools, is 0.57, signifying a moderate positive correlation.

3. **Intercept Coefficient:**
   - The intercept coefficient is nearly zero (-2.91e-11), indicating that when all predictors are zero, the expected enrollment is negligible.
   - Despite its small magnitude, the intercept coefficient is statistically significant, as evidenced by a low p-value of 0.00033.

4. **T-Statistic:**
   - The t-statistic for the intercept coefficient is 3.99, indicating its statistical significance at the 5% level.
   - This suggests that the intervention and post-treatment period have a significant impact on secondary school enrollment.

5. **Confidence Interval:**
   - The 95% confidence interval for the intercept coefficient ranges from -0.49 to 0.49, providing a range of plausible values for the intercept.

### Regression Analysis for Primary Schools:

1. **R-squared and Adjusted R-squared:**
   - The R-squared value of 0.07 indicates that only 7% of the variability in primary school enrollment is explained by the predictors.
   - The adjusted R-squared value of -0.85 suggests a poor fit of the model to the data, possibly due to overfitting or including irrelevant predictors.

2. **Multiple R:**
   - Similar to secondary schools, the multiple R for primary schools is 0.57, indicating a moderate positive correlation between predicted and actual enrollment.

3. **Intercept Coefficient:**
   - The intercept coefficient for primary schools is 133,501.79, indicating the expected enrollment when all predictors are zero.
   - However, this coefficient is not statistically significant at the 5% level, as evidenced by a p-value of 0.118.

4. **T-Statistic:**
   - The t-statistic for the intercept coefficient is 1.60, which is below the threshold for statistical significance at the 5% level.
   - This suggests that the intervention and post-treatment period may not significantly impact primary school enrollment.

5. **Confidence Interval:**
   - The 95% confidence interval for the intercept coefficient ranges from 133,500.08 to 133,503.50, providing a range of plausible values.

### Conclusion:

- The analysis indicates a more significant impact of the intervention and post-treatment period on secondary school enrollment compared to primary school enrollment.
- Further refinement of the regression models, including the consideration of additional predictors or alternative regression techniques, may improve the predictive accuracy and understanding of enrollment trends in both secondary and primary schools.
- Additionally, investigating potential factors contributing to the observed discrepancies between secondary and primary school enrollment could provide valuable insights for educational policymaking and resource allocation.

This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the factors influencing enrollment trends in secondary and primary schools, facilitating informed decision-makin

g in educational planning and policy formulation.
